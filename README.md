# Hi, I'm Piyush ðŸ‘‹

| <blockqoute><p>A [Delhilite](https://goo.gl/maps/GkvyAJzzJ6K2) who loves to dig Deep in the woods of Artificial Intelligence. I like to find new ways to solve not so new but interesting problems. Fitting new models to data and articulating new ways to manipulate and personify things is what I think my field is all about. When not working or playing with data, you'll find me in the gym or writing new blog posts.</p></blockqoute> |![](http://www.piyushmalhotra.in/img/me.jpg)|
